### Description
An LED inspection circuit is developed to show the details about the LED on the LCD display. The LEDs need right voltage and right current to operate. To measure the right voltage, the voltage from source is gradually increamented till the LED turns on. The volateg across the LED is measured and subtracted to the voltage from the source. The voltage calculated is divided by the resistance value and currentin the circuit is calculated.
